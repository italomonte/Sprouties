# 🌱 Sprouties – Healthy eating starts in the garden

**Sprouties** is a multi-device app for **iPhone and Apple Watch**, developed by a team of 2 designers and 5 developers. It helps preschoolers overcome **picky eating** through a playful and educational approach: gardening.

With *Sprouties*, caregivers can track which foods the child already enjoys and which ones they haven’t tried yet, while the child plants, cares for, and harvests vegetables in an **interactive digital garden**.

> This project was developed in collaboration with **Ana Liz Ribeiro**, **Luna Printes**, and other colleagues from the Apple Developer Academy.
